# Python-challenge-1

I am designing an interactive ordering system from a food truck menu, using the skills that I have learned in Python so far.

I will be adapting this menu to allow customers to place an order, which includes storing the customer's order and printing the receipt with the total price of all items ordered. The starter code includes comments, which I have used as a guide for the steps I needed to add.

Order System
I created an empty list that will store as the customer's order. 

Order Receipt
I created a for loop to go through the order list. 
Lastly, the order receipt will be printed for the customer.
